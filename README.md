Laravel seed project
=====================

This is mostly just for myself, a Laravel 5 seed project that I can just download and start developing.

Structure
----------

There's the "Laravel" folder, that contains Vendor, app, and other folders. Basically all the non-public stuff, controllers, plugins, etc.

Then there's the "wwwroot" folder, which is the public folder. It should be renamed if you're not using IIS, in case of Apache it should be www, some hosts have public_html, so just rename it to whatever is in use.
